This cheatsheet is for **version 1** of Magit and many things have
changed considerably in **version 2**, including the key bindings.  If
you are using version 2 (which you should), then instead head over to
the new [homepage](http://magit.vc), which among other things features
a [new manual](http://magit.vc/manual/magit) and a
[semi-official refcard](http://magit.vc/manual/magit-refcard.pdf.  If
you are updating from version 1 to 2, then you should also read the
[update instructions](http://magit.vc/manual/magit/Installation.html).

Magit Cheatsheet
----------------
magit is an emacs mode for git, and is crazy awesome. I've distilled the Magit User Manual into a command-centric cheatsheet for my own purposes. 

The upstream magit project updates itself every so often. If you catch it before I do, please fork and patch!

This project contains...

1. The master org-mode file in case you feel like wrestling with org-mode's org-export-as-html and its weird set of quasi-controls in order to update the cheatsheet.

2. The HTML output of exporting the current version of the org-mode file, so you can compare and contrast.

3. A utility .el file. In order to get org-mode to export nicely, I had to add two user variables to my .emacs, along with a macro I used to quick-replace the TD elements with the classes they need.
